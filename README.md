## Model Providers

This template uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to access multiple AI models through a unified interface. The default configuration includes [xAI](https://x.ai) models (`grok-2-vision-1212`, `grok-3-mini`) routed through the gateway.

### AI Gateway Authentication

**For Vercel deployments**: Authentication is handled automatically via OIDC tokens.

**For non-Vercel deployments**: You need to provide an AI Gateway API key by setting the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to direct LLM providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js + StatelyDB AI Chatbot to Vercel with a few clicks:

First bootstrap with StatelyDB and then Deploy onto Vercel.

[![Build with Stately](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ryan-stately/51a07a4b3123f5cb89c8b9a1f3edf214/raw/158cb441aa65d05dd1a75b85dffad2feeb473f6b/build-icon.svg)](https://console.stately.cloud/new?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FStatelyCloud%2Fai-chatbot)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-name=ai-chatbot&s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FStatelyCloud%2Fai-chatbot&env=STATELY_STORE_ID,STATELY_ACCESS_KEY,ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&envDescription=API%20keys%20and%20Store%20configuration.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stately.cloud%2Fguides%2Fconnect%2F&skippable-integrations=1)

## Running locally

**Clone This Template (or your own if deploying on Vercel)**

```bash setup Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/StatelyCloud/ai-chatbot
cd ai-chatbot
```

**Install Dependencies & Login**

```bash setup Install Dependencies & Login
pnpm install
pnpm run login
```

**Generate the SDK**

```bash setup Generate the SDK
pnpm run generate -- --language typescript --schema-id $SCHEMA_ID ./generated
```

**Start the Application**

```bash setup Run the Application
pnpm dev
```

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
